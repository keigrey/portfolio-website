  "introduction": "I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer, currently living in Nagoya. Lately, I'm spending my time writing code and listening to music in the day and making music and writing poetry in the night. Also in my free time, you can catch me learning languages, plucking my guitar and bass, or hitting pads on my MPD226 and most importantly, acquiring skills I don't yet posses and learning things I don't yet know."
